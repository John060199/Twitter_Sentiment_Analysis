# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using NLP and Python

Welcome to the Twitter Sentiment Analysis project! In this Python-based project, we leverage the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to perform sentiment analysis on tweets. Our goal is to classify tweets into three distinct categories: neutral, negative, and positive sentiments. Whether you're interested in natural language processing, deep learning, or understanding the sentiment dynamics on Twitter, this project offers valuable insights and practical experience.

## Key Objectives

- **Data Collection:** Gather Twitter data using Python libraries and APIs, creating a dataset for training and testing the LSTM model.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Utilize Pandas and NLTK for data cleaning, tokenization, and text preprocessing.
- **LSTM Model Building:** Implement LSTM neural networks using TensorFlow/Keras for sentiment classification.
- **Model Training:** Train the LSTM model on labeled Twitter data to learn sentiment patterns.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics and visualization tools.
- **Sentiment Prediction:** Apply the trained LSTM model to predict the sentiment of new, unlabeled tweets.

## Getting Started

To begin, clone this repository and explore the provided Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts. These resources provide detailed guidance on every step of the project, from data collection to model deployment. You can also customize the code to work with specific Twitter datasets and adapt it to explore different aspects of sentiment analysis.
